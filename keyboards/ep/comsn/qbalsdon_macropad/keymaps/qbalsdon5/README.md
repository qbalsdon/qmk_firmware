# The Anvil MacroPad

I'm still hammering out the name

## Installation from command line

`qmk flash -kb ep/comsn/qbalsdon_macropad -km qbalsdon5`

### Working `qmk doctor` output:

### Fix list:

1. Switch plate
1. Bigger screen holes
1. Invert the rotation on the physical rotary encoders, currently they're the wrong way around
1. Mounting holes on the PCB
1. Talk about under glow acrylic
